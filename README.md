#### Program Functionality:
##### This RPG, Ghoul Harvester, is a Python-structured game written in Pygame. Similarly to Mario, it features a pixelated character that defeats enemies to win the game. The game includes a single map that contains obstacles for the player to overcome and enemies at a regular basis across the map to stop the player from winning. The enemies come in different types (boss, mini-boss, and normal enemy), and they are regulated at a standard tempo and programmed as NPCs whereas the player can be controlled and affected by the user.
##### Although this game is quite irrelevant to our society and does not by any means function as a program that solves a real-world problem, it has the purpose of entertaining any audiences that wish to relieve stress by playing a pleasingly challenging game. This game can be applied to any audience group that wishes to relieve stress by playing video games.

#### New Skills
##### A new skill I learned while working on this project was classes, which was quite useful considering how important they were to the game and its functionality. Essentially, I learned that classes essentially function as blueprints, a specific layout for creation of objects to follow. The class includes the built-in __init__() function that initializes values to the objects

#### Program Functionality
##### Ghoul Harvester was created in Pygame. The main character kills enemies to win the game as well as do some cool parkour. The game has a single area with enemies spawned all over the map that he has to overcome. The player is controlled by the user, but the mini-boss, boss, and enemy are preprogrammed and controlled by the computer.
